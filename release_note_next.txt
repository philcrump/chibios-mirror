*** ChibiOS next Release Notes.                                            ***
******************************************************************************

ChibiOS next is composed of several independent but inter-operable
sub-projects: RT, NIL, SB, HAL, EX. Plus several external libraries
integrated in our structure: WolfSSL, FatFS and lwIP.

*** ChibiOS next highlights ****

- NEW RT 7.0.
- Support for RP2040 and Raspberry Pico board.
- Support for STM32L5xx, STM32WBxx and STM32WLxx.
- Dynamic clock support in HAL.
- Improved STM32 HAL.
- Added ARMv8-M port.

*** ChibiOS next general improvements ***


*** What's new in RT/NIL ports ***

- Addes SMP port for Cortex-M0 required by RP2040.
- The old generic ARMCMx port has been split in ARMv6-M, ARMv7-M and ARMv8-M-ML
  ports.

*** What's new in OS Library 1.3.0 ***

- Internal rework to make it compatible with RT 7.0.0 and NIL 4.1.0.

*** What's new in SB 1.1.0 ***

- Internal rework to make it compatible with RT 7.0.0.
  
*** What's new in RT 7.0.0 ***

- Support for SMP multi-core threading.
- 64 bits monotonic time stamps with the same resolution of Virtual Timers.
- Much more efficient and accurate Virtual Timers in tick-less mode.
- Automatic reload of Virtual Timers, now both one-shot and continuous timers
  are supported.
- Internal reorganization to better fit the general architectural design. For
  example, lists/queus code has been centralized in a dedicated module.


*** What's new in NIL 4.1.0 ***

- Internal rework to make it compatible with RT 7.0.0.

*** What's new in HAL 7.2.0 ***

       
*** What's new in EX 1.2.0 ***


*** What's new in AVR HAL support ***


*** What's new in STM32 HAL support ***


*** What's new in tools ***
